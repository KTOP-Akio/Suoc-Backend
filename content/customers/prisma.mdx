[Prisma](https://prisma.io/) is a popular open-source ORM for Node.js and TypeScript, known for its type-safe database client and query builder. It currently has ~1.5M weekly NPM downloads and is used by millions of developers around the world.

In fact, Dub itself uses Prisma under the hood to handle database queries and migrations – here is our [Prisma Schema](https://github.com/steven-tey/dub/blob/main/prisma/schema.prisma) file, fully open-source as well!

## The challenge

Earlier this month, [Petra](https://twitter.com/petradonka) from the Prisma team reached out with one simple request – they wanted to migrate their existing `pris.ly` short links to Dub.

For context, `pris.ly` links were used in the Prisma client and internal engines to link to documentation and other resources. For example, the following link in the default Prisma schema would redirect to the [Prisma Schema docs page](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema):

/>

In the past, Prisma used a [custom-built solution](https://github.com/prisma/pris.ly) to handle short links. However, this solution was not ideal for a few reasons:

1. **Lack of analytics**: There was no way to track which links were clicked on the most, or which links were broken.
2. **Potential for link conflicts**: As the number of links grew, it became increasingly difficult to ensure that each link was unique.
3. **Slow to update**: Every time a new link was added, it would take ~10 seconds for the new link to be deployed.

## The solution

Dub was the perfect solution for Prisma's use case – given its ease of use and powerful analytics.

In less than a day, Prisma was able to migrate all 250+ of their existing `pris.ly` links to Dub, and the value prop was clear from the start:

1. **Analytics on each link**: Dub provides detailed analytics on each link, including the number of clicks over time, location data, device data, and more.
2. **Easy to create new links**: Dub provides a simple UI to create new links, along with useful features such as [tags](/help/article/how-to-use-tags) to help organize links.
3. **Instant updates**: When a link is added to Dub, it is instantly available to use – no more waiting for 10 seconds for the link to be deployed.

## The results

Since migrating to Dub, Prisma has been able to quickly create new links and track the performance of each link. This gave them insight into which issues their users were running into the most.

As an Enterprise customer on Dub, Prisma has also been leveraging Dub's [SAML/SSO feature](/help/category/saml-sso) to manage access to their links. This has been especially useful for Prisma, as they have been able to easily manage access to links for their entire team.
