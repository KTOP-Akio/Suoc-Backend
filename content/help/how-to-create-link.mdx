Our link builder comes with features like UTM builder, device targeting, password protection, expiration dates, and more.

Dub is also the only link management tool that lets you customize the social media cards for your links, so you can have full control over how your links look when shared on social media.

In this article, we will take a look at how you can leverage these features to create your first short link on Dub.

## Dub.sh links vs custom domain links

When you sign up for Dub, you have the option to choose between the default `dub.sh` domain or your own custom domain to create short links.

Here are the difference between the two options:

|                        | Default `dub.sh` links                                            | Custom domain links                                                                                                                                                                       |
