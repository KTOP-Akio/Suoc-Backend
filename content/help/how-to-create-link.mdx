Our link builder comes with features like UTM builder, device targeting, password protection, expiration dates, and more.

Dub is also the only link management tool that lets you customize the social media cards for your links, so you can have full control over how your links look when shared on social media.

In this article, we will take a look at how you can leverage these features to create your first short link on Dub.

## Dub.sh links vs custom domain links

When you sign up for Dub, you have the option to choose between the default `dub.sh` domain or your own custom domain to create short links.

Here are the difference between the two options:

|                        | Default `dub.sh` links                                            | Custom domain links                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Custom social media cards

Dub is the only link management tool that lets you customize the social media cards for your links, so you can have full control over how your links look when shared on social media.

To leverage this feature, toggle the "Custom Social Media Cards" switch in the link builder. This will reveal the following fields:

1. **Image**: The image that will be used for the social media card. You can upload an image from your computer or drag and drop an image into the field.
2. **Title**: The title that will be used for the social media card (max 120 characters).
3. **Description**: The description that will be used for the social media card (max 240 characters).

- **UTM Source** (`utm_source`): The source of your traffic (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, etc.).
- **UTM Medium** (`utm_medium`): The medium of your traffic (e.g. social, email, etc.).
- **UTM Campaign** (`utm_campaign`): The name of your campaign (e.g. summer2023)
- **UTM Term** (`utm_term`): The term of your campaign (e.g. running+shoes)
- **UTM Content** (`utm_content`): The content of your campaign (e.g. logo+link)

## Password protection

You can protect your links with a password by toggling the "Password Protection" switch in the link builder.

Then, when you share your link, the user will be prompted to enter a password before they can access the destination URL.
