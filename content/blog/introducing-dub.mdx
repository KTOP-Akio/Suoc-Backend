Introducing Dub â€“Â an open-source link-shortener SaaS with built-in analytics + free custom domains.

Some context: Since joining [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), I've had the chance to work with some of the coolest tech on the web.

E.g.: with [Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/features/edge-functions), you can now run server-side logic like redirects at close proximity to users â€“ which is perfect for a tool like Dub.

To visualize how Edge Functions work, I created a 3D globe on our homepage that shows the locations of the last 30 clicks on [dub.sh/github](http://dub.sh/github) in real-time ðŸ‘‡

## Analytics that matter

On top of fast redirects, a link shortener SaaS also needs data visualization to help marketing teams understand the performance of their links.

With [Airbnb's Visx library](http://airbnb.io/visx), I built a dashboard to visualize the time-series data for each link's clicks (incl. location, device/os).

## Use your own custom domain for free

Another cool feature of Dub: free custom domains on all plans.

You can use your own domain for your links (e.g. [stey.me](http://stey.me/)) â€“ even on the free plan.

## Fully open-source and self-hostable

I'm excited to announce that this project is fully open-source, released under the AGPLv3 license ðŸ¥³

This means you can clone, modify, and even deploy your own instance of Dub, as long as you open-source it.

Here's a link to the GitHub repository: [dub.sh/github](https://dub.sh/github)
