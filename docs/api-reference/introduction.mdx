## Base URL

Dub's API is built on REST principles and is served over HTTPS. To ensure data privacy, unencrypted HTTP is not supported.

The Base URL for all API endpoints is:

```
https://api.dub.co
```

## Authentication

Authentication to the Dub API is performed via the Authorization header with a Bearer token. To authenticate, you need to include the Authorization header with the word `Bearer` followed by your token in your API requests like so:

```
Authorization: Bearer <Your-Token>
```

You can get your token under your [Dub Account Settings](https://app.dub.co/settings/tokens).

## Response Codes

The API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Here are a few examples:

| Code  | Description                                                                                    |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200` | The request was successful.                                                                    |
| `400` | The request was invalid or cannot be served.                                                   |
| `401` | The request requires user authentication.                                                      |
| `403` | The server understood the request, but refuses to authorize it.                                |
| `404` | The requested resource could not be found.                                                     |
| `429` | Too many requests.                                                                             |
| `500` | The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request. |

## Rate Limit

Dub's API rate limiting is in conformance with the [IETF standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers):

| Header Name             | Description                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make per hour. |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.              |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds.    |
| `Retry-After`           | The number of seconds to wait before retrying the request again.                |

Dub's API is capped at **10 requests per second** per user.

This is implemented to ensure a fair usage policy so that excessive use by a single user does not adversely affect the performance and usage of the API by others.

You'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response code if the rate limit is exceeded.
