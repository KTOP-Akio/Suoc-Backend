## Introduction

Dub's codebase is set up in a monorepo (via [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo)) and is fully [open-source on GitHub](https://github.com/dubinc/dub).

Here's the monorepo structure:

```
apps
├── docs
├── web
packages
├── tailwind-config
├── tinybird
├── tsconfig
├── ui
├── utils
```

The `apps` directory contains the code for:

- `web`: The entirety of Dub's application ([app.dub.co](https://app.dub.co)) + our link redirect infrastructure.
- `docs`: Dub's documentation site ([dub.co/docs](https://dub.co/docs)) – including this page you're on right now!

The `packages` directory contains the code for:

- `tailwind-config`: The Tailwind CSS configuration for Dub's web app.
- `tinybird`: Dub's Tinybird configuration.
- `tsconfig`: The TypeScript configuration for Dub's web app.
- `ui`: Dub's UI component library.
- `utils`: A collection of utility functions and constants used across Dub's codebase.

## How `app.dub.co` works

Dub's web app is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

It also utilizes code from the `packages` directory, specifically the `@dub/ui` and `@dub/utils` packages.

All of the code for the web app is located in here: [`main`/apps/web/app/app.dub.co](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/tree/main/apps/web/app/app.dub.co)

There's also the API server, which is located in here: [`main`/apps/web/app/api](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/tree/main/apps/web/app/api)

## How link redirects work on Dub

Link redirects on Dub are powered by [Next.js Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware).

To handle high traffic, we use Redis to cache every link's metadata when it's first created. This allows us to serve redirects without hitting our MySQL database.

Here's the code that powers link redirects:

- Link redirects: [`main`/apps/web/lib/middleware/link.ts](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/blob/main/apps/web/lib/middleware/link.ts).
- Root domain redirects: [`main`/apps/web/lib/middleware/root.ts](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/blob/main/apps/web/lib/middleware/root.ts).
