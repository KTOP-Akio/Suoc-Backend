Self-hosting Dub gives you extra control over your data and design.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- A [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account
- A [Tinybird](https://www.tinybird.co/) account
- An [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) account
- A [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/) account

## Step 1: Fork the repository

First, clone the [Dub repo](https://dub.sh/github) into a public GitHub repository. If you are planning to distribute the code, make sure to keep the source code public to comply with our [AGPLv3 license](https://dub.sh/license).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/steven-tey/dub.git
```
