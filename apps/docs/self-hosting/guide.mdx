description: "An end-to-end guide on how to self-host Dub.co â€“ the open-source link management platform."
---

Self-hosting Dub gives you extra control over your data and design.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- A [Tinybird](https://www.tinybird.co/) account
- An [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) account
- A [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/) account
- A [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account

## Step 1: Clone the repository

First, clone the [Dub repo](https://dub.sh/github) into a public GitHub repository. If you are planning to distribute the code, make sure to keep the source code public to comply with our [AGPLv3 license](https://dub.sh/license).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/steven-tey/dub.git
```

## Step 2. Publish Tinybird endpoints

Next, you'll need to publish the Tinybird endpoints:

1. In your [Tinybrd](https://tinybird.co/) account, create a new Workspace.
2. Copy your `admin` [Auth Token](https://www.tinybird.co/docs/concepts/auth-tokens.html). You'll need this in step 5, and also for the `TINYBIRD_API_KEY` environment variable in later steps.
3. In your cloned Dub repo, navigate to the `packages/tinybird` directory.
4. Install the Tinybird CLI with `pip install tinybird-cli` (requires Python >= 3.8).
5. Run `tb auth` and paste your `admin` Auth Token.
6. Run `tb push` to publish the datasource and endpoints in the `packages/tinybird` directory. You should see the following output (truncated for brevity):

```bash
$ tb push

** Processing ./datasources/click_events.datasource
** Processing ./endpoints/clicks.pipe
...
** Building dependencies
** Running 'click_events'
** 'click_events' created
** Running 'device'
** => Test endpoint at https://api.us-east.tinybird.co/v0/pipes/device.json
** Token device_endpoint_read_8888 not found, creating one
** => Test endpoint with:
** $ curl https://api.us-east.tinybird.co/v0/pipes/device.json?token=p.ey...NWeaoTLM
** 'device' created
...
```

## Step 3. Set up Upstash Redis database

Next, you'll need to set up the Upstash Redis database:

1. In your [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) account, create a new database.
2. For better performance & read times, we recommend setting up a global database with several read regions.

3. Once your database is created, copy the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` from the **REST API** section. You'll need these tokens in later steps.
