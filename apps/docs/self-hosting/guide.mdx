description: "An end-to-end guide on how to self-host Dub.co â€“ the open-source link management platform."
---

Self-hosting Dub gives you extra control over your data and design.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- A [Tinybird](https://www.tinybird.co/) account
- An [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) account
- A [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/) account
- A [Resend](https://resend.com/) account
- A [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account

## Step 1: Local setup

First, clone the [Dub repo](https://dub.sh/github) into a public GitHub repository. If you are planning to distribute the code, make sure to keep the source code public to comply with our [AGPLv3 license](https://dub.sh/license).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/steven-tey/dub.git
```

Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

Delete the `apps/docs` directory since it's not needed for self-hosting:

```bash
rm -rf apps/docs
```

Convert the `.env.example` file to `.env`. You can start filling in the first few environment variables:

```bash
# The domain that your app will be hosted on
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_DOMAIN=
# The short domain that your app will be using (could be the same as the above)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_SHORT_DOMAIN=
```

You will fill in the remaining environment variables in the following steps.

## Step 2: Publish Tinybird endpoints

Next, you'll need to publish the Tinybird endpoints:

1. In your [Tinybrd](https://tinybird.co/) account, create a new Workspace.
2. Copy your `admin` [Auth Token](https://www.tinybird.co/docs/concepts/auth-tokens.html). Paste this token as the `TINYBIRD_API_KEY` environment variable in your `.env` file.
3. In your cloned Dub repo, navigate to the `packages/tinybird` directory.
4. Install the Tinybird CLI with `pip install tinybird-cli` (requires Python >= 3.8).
5. Run `tb auth` and paste your `admin` Auth Token.
6. Run `tb push` to publish the datasource and endpoints in the `packages/tinybird` directory. You should see the following output (truncated for brevity):

```bash
$ tb push

** Processing ./datasources/click_events.datasource
** Processing ./endpoints/clicks.pipe
...
** Building dependencies
** Running 'click_events'
** 'click_events' created
** Running 'device'
** => Test endpoint at https://api.us-east.tinybird.co/v0/pipes/device.json
** Token device_endpoint_read_8888 not found, creating one
** => Test endpoint with:
** $ curl https://api.us-east.tinybird.co/v0/pipes/device.json?token=p.ey...NWeaoTLM
** 'device' created
...
```

## Step 3: Set up Upstash Redis database

Next, you'll need to set up the Upstash Redis database:

1. In your [Upstash account](https://console.upstash.com/), create a new database.
2. For better performance & read times, we recommend setting up a global database with several read regions.

3. Once your database is created, copy the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` from the **REST API** section into your `.env` file.

![Upstash Redis tokens](/images/upstash-redis-tokens.png)

4. Navigate to the [QStash tab](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and copy the `QSTASH_URL`, `QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY`, and `QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY` from the **Request Builder** section into your `.env` file.

## Step 4: Set up Planetscale database

In your [Planetscale account](https://app.planetscale.com/), create a new database. You can use the free tier for this project.

Once your database is created, you'll be prompted to select your language or Framework. Select **Prisma**.

![Planetscale choose framework](/images/planetscale-choose-framework.png)

Then, you'll have to create a new password for your database. Once the password is created, scroll down to the **Add credentials to .env** section and copy the `DATABASE_URL` into your `.env` file.

![Planetscale add credentials](/images/planetscale-add-credentials.png)

Going back to your terminal, navigate to the `apps/web` directory and run the following command to generate the Prisma client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

Then, create the database tables with the following command:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

## Step 5: Set up Resend

Next, you'll need to set up Resend for transactional emails (e.g. magic link emails):

1. In your [Resend account](https://resend.com/overview), create a new API key.

![Resend API key](/images/resend-api-key.png)

2. Copy the API key into your `.env` file as the `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable.

## Step 6: Deploy to Vercel

Once you've set up all the databases, you can deploy your app to Vercel:

1. In your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/), create a new project.
