API keys on Dub.co allow other apps to access your workspace programmatically. This is useful for integrating Dub with other tools and services.

Each API key is tied to a specific workspace – meaning you can use it to access that workspace's resources without having to worry about "leaking" access to other workspaces. You also no longer need to pass your [workspace ID](https://dub.co/help/article/how-to-get-workspace-id) in your API requests.

<Tip>Dub API keys are prefixed with `dub_` for easy identification.</Tip>

## API key permissions

You can create 3 types of API keys on Dub.co:

1. **All permissions** – This API key will have full access to all resources.
2. **Read only** – This API key will have read-only access to all resources.
3. **Restricted** – This API key will have restricted access to some resources:
   - [Links](/data-model#links)
   - [Analytics](/api-reference/endpoint/retrieve-analytics)
   - [Workspaces](/data-model#workspace)
   - [Domains](/data-model#domains)
   - [Tags](/data-model#tags)
   - API Keys

Depending on your use case, you might want to use one of these 3 options to limit the scope of the API key and improve security.

## Machine users

On Dub, you can create API keys that are associated with a "Machine user". This is particularly helpful when you don't want to associate the API key with a particular user in your workspace, to avoid security risks in involving turnover or changes in project ownership.

These machine users will show up on your workspace's **People** tab, but will not contribute to your workspace's user count.

<Tip>
  If you delete an API key associated with a machine user, the machine user will
  be deleted. Vice versa, if you delete a machine user, their corresponding API
  key will be deleted as well.
